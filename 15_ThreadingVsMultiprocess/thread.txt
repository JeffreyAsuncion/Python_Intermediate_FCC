Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (A.K.A. "lightweight process)
A process can spawn multiple threads.

+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ lightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks 
    when program has to talk to slow devices ie hard drive or network connection
    it will switch to other threads and od the processing in the meantime

- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time
    no actual parallel computation
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not interruptable/killable
- Careful with race conditions
    a race condition occurs when two or more threads want to 
    modify the same variable at the same time
    This can easily cause bugs or crashes
