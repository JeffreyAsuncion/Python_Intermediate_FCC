We learned that we can easily share data between
threads with a global variable. 

and  now with processes, processes don't live in the same memory space,
so they don't have access to the same public data.

And because of that they need special shared memory objects to 
share data. and there are two shared memory objects that we can use, 
we can use a value for a single value, or we can use an array.
